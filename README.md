# C++-ARRAYS-
ALL ABOUT ARRAYS
A beginner-friendly C++ project: a 1D Treasure Hunt game where the user guesses the hidden treasure's index. Built while learning arrays, randomness, loops, and fighting both syntax errors and overthinking — one cout at a time.

💡 Features:

1D array logic

Random index generation using rand()

Input validation with user attempts count

Console interaction with simple game loop

🛠️ Technologies:
C++ (Console App)

🌱 Motivation:
Created while leveling up my logic-building and debugging skills in C++. Also featuring strong side quests like:

Confusing c0ut with cout

Asking “how does the number become 1?” and then writing the line that made it 1

😄 Built with humor, heartbreak, and hustle.
